Naming conventions for the game project

Node names, Class names and File names-> PascalCase

signals -> use past tense to name e.g. door_opened, score_changed

constants -> CONSTANT_CASE


Use PascalCase for enum names and CONSTANT_CASE for their members, as they are constants:
enum Element {
    EARTH,
    WATER,
    AIR,
    FIRE,
}

functions and variables -> snake_case
